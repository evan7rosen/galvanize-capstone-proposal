# Double R Video Video and Admin Portals

_Evan Rosen's Galvanize Capstone Project_

## Summary

This is a full stack web application for a local video production company that has two main features. First, it enables customers to log into their account, where they can view a list of the videos they have purchased, watch the videos, and purchase additional videos. The second main feature will be an administration portal where the administrator is able to add new videos and customers to the database, as well as manage users and videos to grant or remove access as needed.

4. Still Deciding on the styling... maybe Semantic UI, maybe Material UI, maybe Bootstrap... going to build the back end first and then decide this later.

#### Back End
